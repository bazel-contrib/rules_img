</pre>

Merges multiple deploy operations into a single unified deployment command.

This rule takes multiple operations (typically from image_push or image_load rules)
that provide DeployInfo and merges them into a single command that can deploy all
operations in parallel. This is useful for scenarios where you need to push and/or
load multiple related images as a coordinated deployment.

The rule produces an executable that can be run with `bazel run`.

Example:

```python
load("@rules_img//img:push.bzl", "image_push")
load("@rules_img//img:load.bzl", "image_load")
load("@rules_img//img:multi_deploy.bzl", "multi_deploy")

# Individual operations
image_push(
    name = "push_frontend",
    image = ":frontend",
    registry = "gcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/frontend",
    tag = "latest",
)

image_push(
    name = "push_backend",
    image = ":backend",
    registry = "gcr.io",
    repository = "my-project/backend",
    tag = "latest",
)

image_load(
    name = "load_database",
    image = ":database",
    tag = "my-database:latest",
)

# Unified deployment
multi_deploy(
    name = "deploy_all",
    operations = [
        ":push_frontend",
        ":push_backend",
        ":load_database",
    ],
    push_strategy = "lazy",
    load_strategy = "eager",
)
```

Runtime usage:
```bash
# Deploy all operations together
bazel run //path/to:deploy_all
```

The deploy-merge subcommand will execute all push and load operations in sequence,
allowing for coordinated deployment of related container images.
